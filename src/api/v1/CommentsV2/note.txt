- Instead of designing multiple layers of comment like reddit, we design it to be 2 layers only like facebook
instagram and tiktok.
- We use the same schema structure as the original "Comment Model" but to handle those who reply to layer 2 comment 
(a.k.a child comment replies to child comment) we add an "accountRecipient" for indication.
- We have tested in tiktok, the whole children comments will be deleted if the parent comment is deleted, child comment
replies to children comment, if deleted will have no effect, meaning the later comment section still exist.


return await CommentsModel.findByIdAndDelete(commentId)
    .then(async (comment) => {
      await CommentsModel.deleteMany({ _id: { $in: comment.children } });
      return res.status(200).json({
        code: 1,
        success: true,
      });
    })
    .catch((error) => {
      console.log(error.message);
      return next(createError(500, error.message));
    });
